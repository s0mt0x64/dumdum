*small, no-bloat, no-file,suckless Doom clone that just werks, made for schizos like myself*


_Don't forget to take your meds before you try this_


## Why this game sucks

- **100% non-propertiary**, free of any ads, spyware, microtransactions, corporate logos, planned obsolescence etc.
- **Extemely potato** (much less than Doom, no GPU, no FPU, just kilobytes of RAM and storage).
- **Suckless, KISS, minimal, simple**
- Can fit into **less than 256 kb (60 kb with procgen mod)** (including all content, textures etc.).
- Uses **no build system**, can typically be compiled with a single run of compiler (**single compilation unit**).
- **Works without any file IO**, i.e. can work without config files.
- **Poorly documented and unreadable code**, written by a retard.
- Has the oldschool feel of games like **Doom** or **Wolf3D**:)
